## Game description:
Similar to brawlhalla, the idea was a 2d fighting platformer. You can choose between different characters with their own type of attack.

## Instructions:
Very simple, a and d to move left and right, w to jump and e to attack.

## Features:
Iâ€™ve done all the work by myself so here is what I could do.

You can create or join rooms with a custom name.
Character selection, 2 melee and 1 shooter.
Players are disconnected when they die.
When you join a room with a started fight all information is synchronized.
You can disconnect and reconnect without stopping the game to change character.
Handled no name when room is created or joined.
